Make sure you've set up the mongodb.json file in the secrets folder to link to the database

Also make sure you run npm i to get all the packages required

To get started make a new branch with this naming convention jlietz/dev or dyang/dev or akamenkse/dev and base the branch from main. Then clone the branch down to your local repo.

And make sure whenever you start working on your code again to pull from main into your local branch to make sure you're getting any updated code
